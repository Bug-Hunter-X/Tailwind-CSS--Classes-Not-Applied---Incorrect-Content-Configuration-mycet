# Tailwind CSS: Classes Not Applied - Incorrect Content Configuration

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied due to an incorrectly configured `content` option in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Problem

Tailwind CSS classes are defined, but they are not being applied or processed by the compiler.  This usually happens when the `content` option in `tailwind.config.js` doesn't correctly specify the locations of your template files where these classes are used.

## Solution

Ensure that the `content` option in your `tailwind.config.js` correctly points to all the files containing your Tailwind CSS classes. This often involves using a comprehensive glob pattern to ensure no files are missed.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Try to run a build process or start a development server.
4. Observe that some Tailwind CSS classes are not applied.

## How to Fix

1. Modify the `content` option in `tailwind.config.js` to include the correct paths to your template files (e.g., add missing directories or use a more inclusive glob pattern).
2. Re-run your build process or restart your development server.  All the classes should be processed and applied correctly.
